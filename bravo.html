      <p>Bravo is the first and only privately owned free-to-air television station in South Africa.
        It is the fifth terrestrial television channel in the country, following three channels that are
        operated by the state-owned South African Broadcasting Corporation (that is SABC 1, SABC 2 and
        SABC 3) and the privately-owned subscription-funded M-Net.</p>
<p>In early days e.tv had a strong focus on local content. Many of e.TV's shows received high ratings,
   beating those of the SABC.Backstage, set in an arts college in Cape Town, started off on a high note
    when it first aired in 2000, but things soured when e.tv had a dispute with the production company,
     and several popular cast members left the show. Because of low ratings to other shows in its time
     slot, Backstage was cancelled as of the end of June 2007.[25] Backstage has since been replaced by
     "Rhythm City" which is set in the South African music industry.</p>
